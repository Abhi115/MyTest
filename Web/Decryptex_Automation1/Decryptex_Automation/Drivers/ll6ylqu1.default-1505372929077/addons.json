selector engine) with auto completion for XPath (using TAB or up and down arrows).\n* Evaluate the expression/selector on any HTML or XML documents.\n* Display the result of evaluations in a Firebug-like DOM tree.\n* Highlight the results directly on the document displayed by Firefox (works only with HTML documents).\n* Generate an XPath expression or a CSS selector for an element by right clicking on it and selecting \"Inspect in FirePath\" in the context menu.\n* Define the evaluation context (parent) of an expression/selector.\n* Choose the document in which to evaluate the expression/selector (only applicable for HTML documents with frames or iframes).\n\nFirePath 0.9.7 requires Firefox 3.5 to 6.0 and Firebug 1.4 to 1.8.*\nNote that the XPath auto completion does not work with Firebug 1.6 and higher\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nPierre Tholence\nFirePath has been developed during my master project at DB4ALL.\nDB4ALL.com is a Start-Up at the Database Laboratory at EPFL funded by
